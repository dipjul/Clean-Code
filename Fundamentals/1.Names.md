# Names

 1. <strong>Choose your names thoughtfully</strong>
    - Everytime you choose a name, it should reveal your intent, if you need a comment to help you with this, the name you have choosen doesn't reveal the intend.
    ```
    int d; // elapsed time in days

    int elapsedTimeInDays;
    ```

    - Not a good way:
    ```java
    public static SerialDays addMonths(final int months, final SerialDate base) {
        final int yy = (12 * base.getYYYY() + base.getMonth() + months - 1) / 12;
        final int mm = (12 * base.getYYYY() + base.getMonth() + months - 1) % 12 + 1;
        final int dd = Math.min(base.getDayOfMonth(), SerialDate.lastDayOfMonth(mm, yy));
        return SerialDate.createInstance(dd, mm, yy);
    }
    ```
    - Better way:
    ```java
    public static CalendarDate addMonths(int monthsToAdd, CalendarDate base) {
        int baseYear = base.getYYYY();
        int baseMonth = base.getMonth() - JANUARY;
        int monthsInBaseYear = 12 * baseYear;
        int baseMonths = baseMonth + monthsInBaseYear;
        int resultMonths = baseMonths + monthsToAdd;
        int resultDay = Math.min(base.getDayOfMonth(), CalendarDate.lastDayOfMonth(resultMonth, resultYear));
        return CalendarDate.createInstance(resultDay, resultMonth, resultYear);
    }
    ```


 2. <strong>Communicate you intent</strong>
    - If you have to read the code to understand a name, then it's not a good name.

 3. <strong>Avoid Disinformation</strong>
    - If the names doesn't mean what it said, than it's a Disinformation.

 4. <strong>Pronounceable names</strong>
    - If people can't pronounce the name, then it's not a good name.

 5. <strong>Avoid Encodings</strong>
     - Stop using prefixes like I (interface), m_ (member), etc. Just use names.

 6. <strong>Choose Parts of Speech Well</strong>
    - Classes and variables are nouns, methods are verbs. Boolean variables/methods should be name as predicate. Enums are often adjectives.

 7. <strong>The Scope Rule</strong>
    - Length of the name of a variable is directly proportional to the scope of a variable. Longer the scope of a variable, longer the name of the variable.
    - Length of the name of a function/class is inversely proportional to the scope of a variable. Longer the scope of a function/class, shorter the name of the function/class.
